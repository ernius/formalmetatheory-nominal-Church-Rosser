abstract = "Abstract In [Stoughton, A., Substitution revisited, Theor. Comput. Sci. 59 (1988), pp. 317–325], Alley Stoughton proposed a notion of (simultaneous) substitution for the Lambda calculus as formulated in its original syntax – i.e. with only one sort of symbols (names) for variables – and without identifying α-convertible terms. According to such formulation, the action of substitution on terms is defined by simple structural recursion and an interesting theory arises concerning the connection to α-conversion. In this paper we present a formalisation of Stoughton's work in Constructive Type Theory using the language Agda, which reaches up to the Substitution Lemma for α-conversion. The development has been quite inexpensive e.g. in labour cost, and we are able to formulate some improvements over the original presentation. For instance, our definition of α-conversion is just syntax directed and we prove it to be an equivalence relation in an easy way, whereas in [Stoughton, A., Substitution revisited, Theor. Comput. Sci. 59 (1988), pp. 317–325] the latter was included as part of the definition and then proven to be equivalent to an only nearly structural definition as corollary of a lengthier development. As a result of this work we are inclined to assert that Stoughton's is the right way to formulate the Lambda calculus in its original, conventional syntax and that it is a formulation amenable to fully formal treatment.

abstract = "In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus. "

Furthermore, the proof rules can be used to derive a correct program from a specification as well as to verify that a given program has a certain property.
